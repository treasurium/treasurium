# 👋 Welcome to Treasurium.ai

We are a Web3-native AI automation studio focused on simplifying blockchain adoption through agent-based tools and open-source automation.

Treasurium specializes in building intelligent workflows that combine **AI agents** and **Web3 integration**, with a special focus on the [n8n](https://n8n.io) ecosystem — the most developer-friendly automation platform we've seen for scaling decentralized innovation.

## 🧠 Our Vision

Web3 is powerful, but it's also complicated — especially for non-technical users. Our founders have been in the Web3 and tech industries for decades and have seen this challenge firsthand. After years of building, investing, and consulting in the blockchain industry, one thing became clear:

> **AI will be the bridge to mass adoption of Web3.**

That's why Treasurium is focused on building AI-powered workflows, tools, and infrastructure — using n8n as the foundation — to empower developers, creators, and communities to bring Web3 to life for everyone.
