# 👋 Welcome to Treasurium.ai

We are a Web3-native AI automation studio focused on simplifying blockchain adoption through agent-based tools and open-source automation.

Treasurium specializes in building intelligent workflows that combine **AI agents** and **Web3 integration**, with a special focus on the [n8n](https://n8n.io) ecosystem — the most developer-friendly automation platform we've seen for scaling decentralized innovation.

## 🧠 Our Vision

Web3 is powerful, but it's also complicated — especially for non-technical users. Our founder, **Don Jayamaha Jr** (aka *Don The Gem Dealer*), has been in the Web3 space for over a decade and has seen this challenge firsthand. After years of building, investing, and consulting in the blockchain industry, one thing became clear:

> **AI will be the bridge to mass adoption of Web3.**

That's why Treasurium is focused on building AI-powered workflows, tools, and infrastructure — using n8n as the foundation — to empower developers, creators, and communities to bring Web3 to life for everyone.
